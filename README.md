# Instructions to publish to GitHub Pages:
1. Create a new public GitHub repository (e.g., `is436-umbc-prototype`).
2. Add these files to the repository root.
3. In the repository settings > Pages, set source to the `main` branch root (or `gh-pages` branch) and save.
4. GitHub will give you a URL like: https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/
5. Visit the URL to view the pages (index.html will be the homepage).

Wireframe tools recommended: Balsamiq, WireframePro, Excalidraw. The included wireframes.pdf is a simple draft you can iterate on.
